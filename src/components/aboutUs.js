        The mission of Knight Hacks is to develop the computer science skills of
        UCF students and to build an appreciation for real-world uses of
        programming. We provide weekly workshops on cutting-edge technologies,
        programming, tech interviews, and career development. Members receive
        career guidance through our mentorship program, and develop their skills
        in our projects program. Each year, Knight Hacks hosts UCF's largest
        hackathon, a technology fair and invention marathon where students race
        to build tech projects in 36 hours. Above all, Knight Hacks aims to
        support a diverse, welcoming, and inclusive tech community at UCF.
