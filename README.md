  Knight Hacks Club Site 2021
</h1>

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/KnightHacks/club-site-2021.git
npm install
```

## Getting Started

To run a live development server, run the following in a terminal:

```shell
npm start
```

This will host the website at http://localhost:8000. As you make updates to the
code, the development server will automatically reload the page.

If you get errors, try running `npm install`. Different branches might have
different dependencies installed, so running a fresh `npm install` after each
branch switch is advisable.

## Project Structure

This is a standard Gatsby project. The entrypoint page lives at
`src/pages/index.js`, and most of major logic lives in various components in
`src/components/`.
